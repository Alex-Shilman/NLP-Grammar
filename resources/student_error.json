They learn. The pups learn to walk and drink. They like oonly drinking milk, no meat yet.  They tripple their weight every few weeks and now they are becoming very big, but one does not match.  Soon it will be time for them to leave. They will be able to walk, to hunt, and to start their own family. Something different is what Runt will be.  Today is the day that they leave the den. They will go on and live their own lives. And as soon as we get outside, Runt starts to ask me all these questions! \"What is this, what is that?\" He inquires. He is such a curios boy to want to check outside for the clouds. It is the final time I will see these pups. Wondering what direction they will take some day, I get tears in my eyes. After they leave, I go slow back in the den. We are lonely. I remember the day they were born.  I remember the first time I saw tyhose little eyes and paws. I remember the first time they walked. They is fast. They ran slow.",
